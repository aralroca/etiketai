# Labelai

Labelai is an online tool designed to label images, useful for training AI models.

Annotations are saved as XML files in **PASCAL VOC** format, the format used by ImageNet. Besides, it also supports **YOLO** format.

It's strongly inspired by [**labelImg**](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).
